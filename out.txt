1:The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. 
2:It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. 
3:Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.[13]
4:
5:The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. 
6:Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. 
7:This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. 
8:Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. 
9:The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[14]
